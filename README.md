# Module 4 Report

The PyCity School data presented two surprising school trends.

1 - The first observation was that the more that was spent at the school the worse the students performed.  For schools that spend under $585 per student, the average math score was 83.46 and average reading score was 83.93.  Comparing this to the highest bracket where the schools spent between $645 and $680, the average test scores were only 77 for math and 81 for reading.  This was also seen in school size, where the smaller the school the better the students performed.  Schools under 1000 students averaged 83.8 for math and 83.9 for reading in comparison for schools over 2,000 which averaged 77.7 for math and 81.3 for reading. This observation is assuming that the larger the school the larger the budget to be spent, but this would need to be confirmed with additional research.

2 - A second observation from the data was that Charter schools performed much better on the tests then did the District schools.  Charter schools averaged 83.4 for math scores and 83.9 for reading scores. This was much higher than the 76.9 (math) and 80.9 (reading) scores seen in the District schools.  An interesting follow up to this study would be to see the different teaching techniques employed at the two school types to see where they may have differed.  Also, what is the criteria for students attending Charter schools?  Are they there by choice and do the Charter school specialize in certain fields that may increase the test scores?

In conclusion, the data suggests that schools spending less, going to a smaller school and attending a Charter school are beneficial to test scores.  Additional research and data would be required to confirm these observations or to determine a root cause for these results.
